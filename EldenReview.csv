"Not for the first time, a Miyazaki game has arrived and the landscape appears transformed. As you play, there is a sense of plates shifting beneath you, of the T&Cs of game development being hastily rewritten. We haven’t felt this way since “Breath of the Wild.” Here, as there, an open world means freedom and fresh air. [Issue#370, p.96]",100
"I’ve absolutely enjoyed my time with Elden Ring, and while I’d say my expectations were high prior to playing the game, those expectations have certainly been met or even exceeded along my journey. It feels like a culmination of everything FromSoftware has accomplished in the genre so far, offering up a robust world with tons of exploration married to the unique combat we’ve come to expect from their previous titles. I can’t necessarily say that there’s enough changes here that will appeal to people who have bounced off of Souls games previously, but it’s such a great looking (and playing) game that I think if you enjoy action-RPG’s in the slightest that it’s still worth a shot. And of course if you’re already a FromSoftware fan, then I’d imagine you’re already on board, and I can safely say that you won’t be disappointed.",100
"Elden Ring is a constantly surprising adventure that has taken FromSoftware’s tried-and-tested formula to delirious new heights. One of the best video games of the last decade, and an absolutely essential release, Elden Ring really does confirm that 2022 is off to an incredible start. ",100
"After years of success, which each entry into fromsoftwares legacy, Elden Ring was hyped to be the pinnacle of the Souls experience. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t live up to the hype. It feels like a step back from the progress sekiro and Bloodbourne made. The open world is bland, empty and boring. Finding reasons to continue playing the game gets more and more difficult as time goes on. It is nowhere near FromSofts best entry, arguable being their worst. It feels like open world dark souls 1. A major step back. Completely disappointing. Rampant with performance issues and bugs. I could not see myself recommending this game to anyone",60
"Games very good, sometimes my frames drop a bit on Xbox one s. Everyone complaining is so critical about everything. Just play the game and any serious performance issues will probably get helped in a patch so shush.",90
"All things considered, Elden Ring is a crowning achievement for FromSoftware but also for gaming. It takes the overused open world formula and flips it with a focus on exploration and freedom. It eliminates those limiting markers and quest objectives which every game since The Witcher 3 has used and that have really dampened the open world formula. For a game all about tradition, with its fantasy aesthetic and kings or rulers, it is amazing that Elden Ring breaks the mold and tradition by making such a compelling and intriguing experience. Once the bugs have been ironed out, there is no doubt in my mind that Elden Ring will be looked upon as one of the best games ever created despite the difficulty. It will be looked upon as a genre defining classic. ",95
"Elden Ring needed to be fresh and bold, and it succeeds, putting you in charge of your own adventure. However the open world has some uneven terrain. ",80
"This review contains spoilers. This game compared to Dark Souls 2, make it look good, the combat is so bad, like they didn't even tried to balance it",50
I don't want to be banned from playing even such lame games that are full of bugs and do not shine with graphics that reveal all the possibilities of the new generation. generations of hypocrisy and political games,0
"The first 25 hours of this game are the absolute peak of video-game. A cool gameplay, a new and diverse world to explore, new enemies, cool spells and weapons, cool side-bosses and stuff, nice cinematics and all.
Then, you continue playing and starts to realize that the game is so unbalanced that hurts. Enemies with too many health, exhausting and loooong combos that kill you with 2-3 moves and a very aggressive behavior, that dont give you a chance to initiate a combo. Really, many enemies in this game have 10000 of poise, and they simply dont feel your hits, then proceed to obliterate you with 2-3 hits, even if you have 43-50 in vitality, alongside the fact that seems that every enemy in this game has some magic ou spell in their moveset, making them almost perfect in combat. All enemies and bosses uses the same strategy, they trick you by fake or prolonging moves that would look very fast and some of them are really fast that you have like 0.3 second to evade or take a literal combo of 30 moves that f*cking kill you.
The world exploration is literally not worthy, you might find some SUPER OP secondary bosses that would give you not enough runes and a useless item. Plus, they are almost the same and the dungeons are almost the same as well, super boring.
FromSoftware tried to create a ""easy mode"" by letting you catch ""Pokemon Souls"" and throw them to help you at combat and improve the usage of magic in the early-game, then they ruined the STR and DEX players that wont really care or would use this type of mechanic.
This game really needs a balancing or the majority of the players are not gonna enjoy it. I'v played DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne, they are hard, not unfair as this game is.
Miyazaki proved that he CANNOT create a open-world game and Dark Souls shouldnt be a open-world game. In all games the world is dead and empty of good people but full of boring enemies. Try again later, because this game was a failure.",50
"This game is average but IMO the worst FromSoft game I played. I can't understand people giving this buggy, unfinished and unfair mess a perfect 10/10 and we shouldn't give FS slack for lacking polish in their game, time and time again, as compared to other studios.
This game is the definition of quantity over quality. FS games have always been about the right mix of challenge and frustration in encounters. The bosses in this game are horrible with hyper aggression (all of them), tons of damage, AOE spams and 1 hit combos with (mostly) no telegraphing. In addition, areas are so badly balanced that one moment you slay enemies left right and center with no problem and the next - in the same area - get gutted by one type like you never played before.

In short: The game has technical flaws (e.g., bad performance), feels dated, inconsistent and imbalanced difficulty (e.g., death combos and a lot of trial and error encounters) and enemy design (e.g., rehash's), some very bland and uninspiring environments which lack in atmosphere, frustrating gameplay mechanics (e.g., no omni-roll which players have asked for since DS1), a lackluster story (which must be put together by the players themselves) and bad boss lineup (i.e., very inconsistent and often bigger versions of normal enemies). Overall, I would say this game leans more towards frustration than meaningful challenge and fixing some of the above mentioned would probably make it better.

For me personally, I miss more confined and scripted levels which are more atmospheric but where encounters feel ""designed"". However, what does it for me is that this game has the worst overall quality for bosses (a lot more mind you and there are good ones but quality over quantity), some poor enemy designs and the overall (lack of) balance for various encounters",50
"irst I would like to start by saying that giving this game a ten is not serious and giving it a 0 just because you are pissed at it is childish.
I have always been a very big fan of the Soulborne serie, I finished every one of them multiple times these are awesome games.
Elden Ring is a good game but its not great, for me its kind of a deception.
Dont get me wrong the gameplay mechanic is good, the graphic are fine, some environments are beautifull to watch and I like the idea of an open world soul games, I always wanted that.

One major problem is, its not rewarding, the ennemies are not giving anything worth the time it take to kill them including the boss, its grindy to a point that it is boring just to level up once.
That make the random coop to help peoples killing their boss almost useless.
Many hard and massives ennemies are giving around 50 runes (souls) even if they take 5 minutes to kill, when you need aroung 10 000 runes to lvl up its dumb.
Thats why so many peoples are relaying on a stupid runes run like the boulder that drop around 2000 runes when you let it fall of the cliff, what a joke...

Is it me or almost every big monsters, mini boss and main boss have now a sniper attack and an aoe that smash the ground creating a blast of wind destroying everything around them for a 15 feets radius, so many boss are difficult just because of that, its cheap and lame.
There is a lot of giants in the first part of the map and they all do the ""Dovahkiin"" scream attack that can hurt you and make you fall from your horse even if you are 500 feets away from them.
Many monsters seem to have unlimited stamina and will lend an never ending serie of hits on your face and many of them seem to move like a ninja even if they are obese.

That bring me to the horse, since nothing is worth killing I found myself just running aroung with the horse avoiding the monsters who are not worth my time just to collect items and find dungeons, this make the concept of open world pretty boring to me.

Next the coop, that is my biggest deception in the game, its like the old system, you summon somebody in a restricted zone, kill the boss then they are kicked out of your game.
Me and my friends were mad when we found out that there was a massive fog gate stopping us from getting acces to an entire island just because I killed the boss at the end of the castle, this is pathetic, no evolution whatsoever even for a so call open world.
When you take a look at some great coop game like (Remnant from the Ashes) where you can coop with the same two peoples from start to finish without interruption, getting refreshing health, potions and ammunitions at the checkpoint togetter there is no excuse to give us the same old crappy coop system like in Demon Soul on the ps3.
This is lazy and weak.

And the checkpoints make no sense at all, sometime you will find two checkpoints close to each other with nothing dangerous between them and sometime you will face hordes of dangerous and aggressives beast hoping to find the next checkpoint 10 miles further.

In conclusion Elden Ring is not bad but its not great, it could have been one of the best game ever but there is too many flaws and stupids concept to make it what it should be.
For me its a 7 that could have been a solid 9, sadly its not.",70
"This is easily the worst game FromSoftware has ever made. If you like to ride around on a horse in a big, empty open world for 50 hours, and you like to run the exact same three copy/paste dungeons with the exact same five copy/paste bosses for 70 hours, then this is the game for you. If you like an egregiously unbalanced and unfair endgame then you'll love Elden Ring. If you like encountering bosses that the developers didn't bother balancing for your play style on a regular basis throughout the game, then why are you reading this review and not playing Elden Ring? The massive, empty open world completely destroys any prospect of replay ability for people that have lives and responsibilities. This review is coming from somebody that has been a massive fan of FromSoftware since 2011, and has gotten the platinum trophy on all of their games including Elden Ring. This game may just beat out Dark Souls 2 for the worst FromSoftware game of all time.",60
